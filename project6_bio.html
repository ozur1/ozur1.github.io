      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Ori Zur is an Israeli-American composer and multi-instrumentalist.
        Born in Los Angeles, CA, Zur discovered his passion of music at a very early age.
        He began playing the piano at age 3, and while his main focus was playing classical pieces,
        Zur also very much enjoyed learning how to play pop songs by ear. He used this skill
        throughout his elementary school years by learning all of the melodies
        of his Jewish school's services and accompanying the cantor every Friday afternoon.
        </p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Zur began playing cello when he was 8 years old. His dad wanted him to learn
          an instrument that would allow him to play in an orchestra. Zur began playing in
          an after-school club orchestra a year later, which taught him the basic skills of
          playing in a musical ensemble. He would continue to play cello in middle school,
          high school, and even professional ensembles.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In middle school, Ori also joined his school's jazz band. While transitioning
          from classical piano to jazz piano was difficult at first, Ori eventually fell in love
          with the jazz genre and over the years became more and more comfortable with pushing
          his boundaries of harmony and rhythm. Zur never lost his passion for classical music,
          and he continues to learn new classical piano pieces on his own to this day.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Zur's composition career began in his junior year of high school. He was assigned
          by his school's play director to write and direct music for the school's winter
          play. This experience taught Zur many valuable skills including how to lead and
          teach new music to an ensemble of fellow students, how to collaborate with the
          actors on stage, and how to write melodies that are both appropriate to the
          current scene of the play and simple enough that it would be memoroble for the audience.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The success of the winter play opened the door for other opportunities to contribute
          to his school's performing arts department. Zur composed a few short songs for his
          school's annual Playwrights Festival, participated in pit orchestras for school musicals,
          and provided piano accompaniment for his school's comedy improv troupe, "The Scenemonkeys."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>This was also the time when Zur began composing classical music for the first time.
          He wrote multiple pieces for a variety of instruments. At the end of his senior year,
          Zur was given the opportunity to conduct his school's symphony orchestra as they
          played one of his original pieces, titled "Ode to Peace." He was also able to perform
          an original jazz big band arrangement with his school's top jazz band at his final
          concert.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>As a student at Northwestern University, Zur continues to pursue his passion of composition,
          writing classical chamber music and also writing film scores for students in the Radio,
          TV, and Film department. Zur also continues to play cello in school orchestras, and even joined
          Northwestern's Jewish a Cappella group as a bass singer and vocal percussionist. Zur's dream is
          to become a film and televesion composer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Zur is also pursuing a degree in computer science at Northwestern University. He hopes that
          learning fundemental coding skills and studying the inner workings of a computer will be advantageous
          as he learns about the intersection of technology and modern electronic and computer generated music.
